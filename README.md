# Building the project

> NOTE: If you don't have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, make sure to install it before proceed!


Since the project is powered by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and [SocketIO](), please make sure that you have installed all of them **(via npm)** before you build it.

To start building the project, open the Command Prompt then go to the project folder. You can do one of those things:
- Run `npm start` to preview the app
- Run `npm make` to start building the app

The output application (after running `npm make`) will be stored in the `out` folder in the project directory.
