# Building the project

> NOTE: If you don't have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, make sure to install it before proceed!


Since the project is powered by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and [SocketIO](), please make sure that you have installed of them before you build it.

To start building the project, open the Command Prompt then go to the project folder. You can do one of those things:
- Run `npm start` to preview the app
- Run `npm make` to start building the app

The output application (after running `npm make`) will be stored in the `out` folder in the project directory.
